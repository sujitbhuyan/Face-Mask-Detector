# Face-Mask-Detector
### Problem Statement
India has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic since 30 January 2020 when the first case of COVID-19 was reported. With the Unlock 4.0 phase set to begin in September, the need to be proactive is now more than ever. The objective is to create a Real-Time Face Mask Detector which can solve monitoring issues in crowded areas such as Airports, Metros, etc. using CNN and OpenCV

### Dataset Description
The dataset is an artificial set of face mask images

• Total Images: 1376

• with_mask images:

• without_mask images:

The goal is to create a Deep Learning model to detect in real-time whether a person is wearing a face mask or not

### Aim of the Project
The dataset consists of 1376 images consisting of two classes– with_mask and without_mask. The objective to create a Face Mask Detector using CNN and OpenCV.

### Task to be Performed
.ipynb file As a part of this test, you will be performing the following tasks:

• Prepare a detailed python notebook using CNN for detecting Face Masks in Real-time

• Import Required Libraries

• Load and Pre-process the dataset

• Visualize the dataset

• Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

• Compile the Model

• Train the Model

• Evaluate the Model

• Detect the Face Masks using the HaarCascade_frontalface_default.xml file in real time
